### **Connectra â€“ Video Call Application (MERN Stack)**

**Description**:
Developed **Connectra**, a real-time video calling web application using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) integrated 
with **WebRTC** and **Socket.io** for peer-to-peer communication. The platform enables secure one-on-one video calls with features like room-based call 
initiation, dynamic user signaling, and real-time status updates.
Implemented user authentication (JWT-based), a responsive React frontend for seamless user experience, and scalable backend services for managing signaling and 
session control. The system supports instant call notifications, microphone/camera toggles, and connection handling for smooth and reliable communication.

**Key Technologies**: MERN, WebRTC, Socket.io, JWT, REST API, Tailwind CSS

* Real-time bi-directional communication using WebRTC & Socket.io
* Secure login/register functionality with protected routes
* Room ID-based video sessions with dynamic user connections
* Clean, responsive UI for cross-device compatibility
